        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a <strong>Consultant (Grade I)</strong> at the
          <strong>National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG)</strong>, Ministry of
          Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India, based in
          New Delhi. I work on evaluation and strengthening of public service
          delivery systems, including <strong>Right to Service (RTS) Acts</strong> and
          digital governance portals across Indian states.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently completed my <strong>Ph.D. in Economics</strong> at the
          <strong>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore</strong>, Department of
          Humanities and Social Sciences, under the supervision of
          <strong>Dr. Kalandi Charan Pradhan</strong>. My doctoral research focuses on
          internal migration, urban exposure, and later-life health outcomes among
          older adults in India, using data from large-scale surveys such as LASI and
          other national datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly, my research interests include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internal migration and life-course trajectories</li>
          <li>Ageing and health inequalities in low- and middle-income countries</li>
          <li>Urban exposure, obesity, and cardiometabolic risks</li>
          <li>Subjective wellbeing, mental health, and successful ageing</li>
          <li>Governance and public service delivery in India</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Current Themes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Later-life migration and successful ageing:</strong>
            How migration histories and urban exposure shape physical health,
            functional limitations, depression, and subjective wellbeing among older
            adults in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Urban exposure and obesity:</strong>
            Investigating how the timing, duration, and intensity of urban residence
            influence obesity and related health risks among middle- and older-aged
            migrants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mental health and functional limitations:</strong>
            Examining the pathways through which functional disabilities and social
            exclusion affect depression among older migrants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Governance and service delivery:</strong>
            Evaluating the implementation of Right to Service Acts, digital portals,
            and grievance redress systems in Indian states.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Theoretical &amp; Conceptual Lens</h3>
        <p>
          My work draws on <strong>life-course perspectives</strong>,
          <strong>cumulative (dis)advantage</strong>, and
          <strong>capability approaches</strong> to understand how early-life and
          mid-life opportunities and constraints shape health and wellbeing in older
          age. I also engage with comparative frameworks linking migration,
          urbanisation, and inequalities in later life.

        <h2>Policy &amp; Consultancy Work</h2>
        <p>
          At the National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG), I contribute to
          <strong>evaluation studies</strong> and <strong>policy support</strong> for
          Union and State governments in India. My recent work includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assessing the implementation and outcomes of
            <strong>Right to Service (RTS) Acts</strong> in states such as Haryana,
            Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analysing administrative data from digital service delivery portals
            (e.g., SARAL, Aaple Sarkar, MP e-District) to understand patterns in
            applications, approvals, delays, and grievance redressal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting evaluations of national skill development and public service
            schemes, including sampling design, survey tools, and analytical
            frameworks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These engagements allow me to bridge rigorous academic research with
          <strong>practical governance reforms</strong> and contribute to
          evidence-based policymaking in India.
